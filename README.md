I couldn't add multiple levels to the game due to lack of time and the game being huge
Healing/Damage/Long-Rest work
Password Change etc...

Somethings I didn't like -

Deleting personal comments because it's required for some reason , when ever I want to check my project later down the road I won't have my comments

Keeping files about 200 lines , which is too little for these kind of project in my opinion


-----------------------------------------
tsx was a challenge 
I could not achieve my goal due to the project being bigger than I thought I wanted to add multiple levels and unlocks , was too much data and I ran out of time
